this has nothing to do with the rest of the repo but idk where to put this

let's figure out what term it is based on the date

## Notes

This is based on calendars from the 2004–2005 school year to 2028–2029. Summer session dates are only available from 2009–2010 to 2022–2023.

Winter quarter always starts between January 3 and 9.

| Quarter   | Start day\* | End day  |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| Fall      | Thursday    | Saturday |
| Winter    | Monday      | Saturday |
| Spring    | Monday      | Friday   |
| Summer I  | Monday      | Saturday |
| Summer II | Monday      | Saturday |

\*Based on when instruction begins, as opposed to the administrative quarter start date.

Breaks:

- Spring break is always a week long.
- There are always two weeks between spring quarter and summer session I.
- Summer sessions I and II are always adjacent (there is no break between them).
- After summer session II, there are another 2 weeks until fall quarter week 0.

Finals:

- For fall, winter, and spring quarters, finals always begin the Saturday before the end of the quarter.
- For summer sessions, the finals occur in the last two days of the quarter.

Therefore, in a given year,

- Winter quarter weeks 1–10 and finals (11 weeks)
- Spring break (1 week)
- Spring quarter weeks 1–10 and finals (11 weeks)
- Summer break I (2 weeks)
- Summer session I weeks 1–5 (5 weeks)
- Summer session II weeks 1–5 (5 weeks)
- Summer break II (2 weeks)
- Fall quarter weeks 0–10 and finals (12 weeks)
- Winter break (3–4 weeks)
- = 52–53 weeks in a year

Exceptions:

- In 2006, fall quarter was one week earlier, moving a week of summer break into winter break. I'm not sure why.
- In 2014 and 2020, fall quarter was delayed by a year, moving a week of winter break into summer. I'm not sure why.
- It seems that in S121, S122, and S222, instruction ends on the same day finals start, which suggest that classes may overlap with finals. This might be an error.
