What if 👀 i made 👉👈 another schedule app 👁👁 but for ucsd 😮💦

## Development

$ npm install --global coffeescript pug-cli sass http-server

# idk
$ chmod +x scripts/build.sh scripts/watch.sh scripts/deploy.sh

# Build
$ ./scripts/build.sh

# Update files (run build.sh at least once first)
$ ./scripts/watch.sh

# Deploy
$ ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

## Features that I want

This is just a personal app.

- View all five days at once (can be squished on phones, whatever, web design is
  my passion)
- Keep track of my professor names and section codes (I will probably remember
  them eventually, though)
- Show the time left until the next class
  - This can be a bit smart-dumb in that if the next class is on Monday and it's
    Friday evening, it'll calculate it across days
- Show a notification for a given Zoom link for remote classes
- Hard code the quarter start/end times and final times and holidays, perhaps

Maybe I can also add the ability to add homework due dates since they seem a lot
simpler and fixed than high school.

Eventually, I can open this up to other people by having a way to import classes
from WebReg (by pasting some JS in the console, probably).
